## Project Topic:Amazon product Sales Analysis using Excel
### Project Overview 

This project involved analyzing Amazon product data to understand pricing, discount trends, customer engagement (ratings), and potential revenue. The main goal was to identify key business insights, such as high-performing product categories, effects of discounts on sales potential, and customer satisfaction metrics.
### Tools used

Microsoft Excel

Used for data cleaning, pivot analysis, and dashboard creation.
### Data Source

The dataset used was a cleaned dataset representing Amazon product listings, which included product categories, prices, discounts, ratings, and potential revenue. The original source was not specified, but appears structured for analytical purposes.
### Data Cleaning and Preparation 

Removed unnecessary columns and duplicates.
Standardized column names and formats.
Derived new variables such as:
Discount Percentage (based on actual vs. discounted price)
Discount Bucket (grouping discount ranges)
Potential Revenue (discounted price Ã— rating count)
Ensured consistency across product categories with possible overlaps (e.g., multiple categories for one product).
