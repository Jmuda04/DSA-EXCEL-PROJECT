# DSA-EXCEL-PROJECT
## Project Topic:Amazon product Sales Analysis using Excel
### Project Overview 

This project involved analyzing Amazon product data to understand pricing, discount trends, customer engagement (ratings), and potential revenue. The main goal was to identify key business insights, such as high-performing product categories, effects of discounts on sales potential, and customer satisfaction metrics.
### Tools used

Microsoft Excel

Used for data cleaning, pivot analysis, and dashboard creation.
### Data Source

The dataset used was a cleaned dataset representing Amazon product listings, which included product categories, prices, discounts, ratings, and potential revenue. The original source was not specified, but appears structured for analytical purposes.
### Data Cleaning and Preparation 

- Removed unnecessary columns and duplicates.
- Standardized column names and formats.
- Derived new variables such as:
- Discount Percentage (based on actual vs. discounted price)
- Discount Bucket (grouping discount ranges)
- Potential Revenue (discounted price × rating count)
- Ensured consistency across product categories with possible overlaps (e.g., multiple categories for one product).
### Exploratory Data Analysis 
Using pivot tables and basic Excel charts, the following insights were obtained:

Top Revenue-Generating Categories: Some accessory-related categories contributed significantly to revenue.

Rating Patterns: Products with higher ratings tended to generate more revenue, highlighting the importance of customer satisfaction.

Discount Effect: Products within the 60–70% discount bucket did not always correlate with higher ratings or revenue.

High-Rated Products: Products with rating counts above 20,000 were identified as top-performing.
### Recommendation 

Focus on High-Engagement Products: Promote and stock items with high rating counts and good reviews.

Optimize Discounts: Discounts between 30–50% showed healthy performance without excessive revenue loss.

Category Refinement: Streamline product categories for better tracking and reporting, as some products appear in multiple similar categories.
